# Quote App

This project is a Quote App that retrieves and displays inspiring quotes. The backend is a Node.js application that handles the storage and retrieval of quote data, while the frontend (e.g., an Android application) consumes this data to display quotes to the users.
## Android application

The configuration is in the `.env` file. To change the backend application URL, update the relevant variable in this file.

Main android file:
/app/src/main/java/com/example/finalassignment/MainActivity.kt
